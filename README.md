# TwO-O-Player Math Game

## Description

A 2+ Player math game where players take turns to answer simple math addition
problems. A new math question is generated for each turn by picking two numbers
between 1 and 20. The player whose turn it is is prompted the question and must
answer correctly or lose a life.

## Details

Players start with 3 lives. They lose a life if they mis-answer a
question. At the end of every turn, the game should output the new scores for
players, so players know where they stand.

The game doesn’t end until one player is left standing. At this
point, the game should announce who won and what the other player’s score is.
